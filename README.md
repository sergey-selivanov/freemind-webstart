# freemind-webstart

FreeMind 1.0.1 repacked for Webstart.

This webstart app registers association with *.mm files, so it will launch FreeMind
and open file if you'll double-click on .mm file.

Here, FreeMind files repacked from original binary distribution, not recompiled from source.
I just added the launcher. Note that repacked files will be signed with self-signed generated certificate,
so you will need to enable certain security settings.
